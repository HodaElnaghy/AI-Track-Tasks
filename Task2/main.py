z=200/100  #z=2.0


k=(1.1+2.2!=3.3 )
# 1.1 = 1.0001100110011001101 ,, 2.2 = 10.00110011001100110011
# so, the machine will add the two binary numbers together
# and the value will be approximately but not exactly equal 3.3
# so K = True


y=  k and isinstance(z,int)
# y = False
#as z is not integer
